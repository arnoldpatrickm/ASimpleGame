# ASimpleGame
Objective:
create a game that presents a word and starts a timer. Using event listeners, the game then checks for the correct key to be input, however if the wrong key is input the text shrinks up to 3 times. On the third failure the time stops and GameOver appears. If all letters are input correctly the user is told "good job, try another?". Have a counter for number of wins in a row

Aesthetic Details:
When a correct letter is input, there should be a visual change to let the player know which letter they are on (maybe greyed out, or take away the letter completely)
When the word is completed, it can be turned all gold, or just dissapear.
when inputing an incorrect letter the letter could turn red.

Using:
HTML/CSS/Javascript

Testing:
test to make sure that all standard keys constitute an input including numbers
not case sensitive, keep it simple
shrink on incorrect input
test counter continuity
test timer reset on new word
failure shows GameOver screen
